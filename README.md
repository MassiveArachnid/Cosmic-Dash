It's basically what you'd get if you mixed Minecraft with No Man's Sky and Terraria, but focused on making the tech run really efficiently. The sprite instancing and chunk loading are especially snappy, though there's still room to push the instancing even further.
Built to prove you can do large-scale space exploration with detailed worlds you can actually modify, while keeping all the fun RPG stuff that makes these games addictive. Still rough around the edges, but the core systems work great!

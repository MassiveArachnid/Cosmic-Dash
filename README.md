# Cosmic-Dash
A voxel sandbox that mixes space exploration with RPG progression. Zip between planets in a simulated solar system, gather resources, and build up your character while reshaping entire worlds.
The Big Features
Space & Planets

Fully simulated solar system with orbits and gravity
Each planet has its own destructible voxel terrain
Seamless transition from space to surface
Comets and asteroids that actually orbit and impact

Tech Under The Hood

Optimized voxel engine with baked ambient occlusion
Lightning-fast chunk loading
3D sprite instancing system that handles thousands of objects
Runs smooth even on basic hardware

RPG Elements

Multiple character classes with unique skills
Gear progression and crafting system
Resource gathering and inventory management
Planet-specific materials and items

The sprite instancing and chunk loading are especially snappy, though there's still room to push the instancing even further.
